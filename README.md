# 3D Motion Sensing Interactive System

## Context

3D motion-sensing interaction is one of the most important fields of HCI research, because of its enormous creative potential and application value. As everyone knows, the information people obtain from vision is about 80 percent of the total information they get, and the natural human actions are three-dimensional. Thus, 3D motion-sensing can obtain and output the richest interaction information and offer user realistic interactive experience. The 3D display can greatly enhance the user's immersion experience by providing more details and stronger visual impact. And the motion controller allows user a more intuitive way to communicate with the computer and support richer modes of operation.

There are two key modules in 3D motion-sensing interactive applications. One is 3D image rendering, especially the "Virtual human model" which can follow user's movement in real time, and the other is motion controller such as "Gestures mouse". The implementation of these two modules is the most important and universal part of the application development process. Based on Microsoft Direct3D and Kinect, this project establishes the base platform of 3D motion-sensing interactive system and develops the "Virtual Human Model" and "Gestures Controller".
